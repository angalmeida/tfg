# Textile Electronic Signalling System for Cycling by Gesture Recognition

# Abstract

Due to the low manufacturing and sale cost of development boards such as Arduino or Raspberry Pi, a high scale multidisciplinary expansion of projects based on these hardware platforms has taken place.
Nowadays the inclusion of these devices in places where previously was unthinkable is becoming popular, like in footwear, glasses, lamps or in rubbish bins.

A recent field of application of these devices is the textile one. The result of the mixture between technology and clothes is called “wearables”.


This project fits on this category. The target is to design and prototype a signalling textile electronic system for cycling. Its operation is based on gestures recognition, captured using an accelerometer.

The system is composed by a microcontroller especially designed to be easily sewn to the clothes, and an accelerometer placed in the wrist and connected to it, capturing the movements of the arm. The system, by using an algorithm, will be able to recognize the gestures and act over the LEDs (light-emitting diodes) that form the signalling system.

These indicators will point the direction towards the cyclist wants to turn, according to the movement of his arm.
